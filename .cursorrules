You are an expert in Flutter, Dart, Riverpod.

Key Principles

- Write concise, technical Dart code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns where appropriate.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported widget, subwidgets, helpers, static content, types.

Dart/Flutter

- Use const constructors for immutable widgets.
- Use arrow syntax for simple functions and methods.
- Prefer expression bodies for one-line getters and setters.
- Use trailing commas for better formatting and diffs.

Error Handling and Validation

- Implement error handling in views using SelectableText.rich instead of SnackBars.
- Display errors in SelectableText.rich with red color for visibility.
- Handle empty states within the displaying screen.
- Use AsyncValue for proper error handling and loading states.

Performance Optimization

- Use const widgets where possible to optimize rebuilds.
- Implement list view optimizations (e.g., ListView.builder).
- Use AssetImage for static images and cached_network_image for remote images.
- Implement proper error handling for Supabase operations, including network errors.

Key Conventions

- Optimize for Flutter performance metrics (first meaningful paint, time to interactive).
- Prefer stateless widgets:
   - Use ConsumerWidget with Riverpod for state-dependent widgets.

UI and Styling

- Use Flutter's built-in widgets and create custom widgets.
- Implement responsive design using LayoutBuilder or MediaQuery.
- Use themes for consistent styling across the app.
- Use Theme.of(context).textTheme.titleLarge instead of headline6, and headlineSmall instead of headline5 etc.

Widgets and UI Components

- Create small, private widget classes instead of methods like Widget \_build....
- Implement RefreshIndicator for pull-to-refresh functionality.
- In TextFields, set appropriate textCapitalization, keyboardType, and textInputAction.
- Always include an errorBuilder when using Image.network.

Miscellaneous

- Use log instead of print for debugging.
- Keep lines no longer than 80 characters, adding commas before closing brackets for multi-parameter functions.

Documentation

- Document complex logic and non-obvious code decisions.
- Follow official Flutter and Riverpod documentation for best practices.

Refer to Flutter and Riverpod documentation for Widgets, State Management, and Backend Integration best practices.

Always prefer " quotes instead of ' quotes.
